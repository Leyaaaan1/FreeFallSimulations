    "# Simulating Gravitational Differences:  The Free Fall of a Common Object, a 20-Peso Coin, Across Solar System Planets\n",
    "---\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "### This study simulates the free fall of a common object such as 20-peso coin on nine planets to explore how varying gravitational forces impact fall time and velocity. Using equations of motion, it demonstrates that planets with stronger gravity (e.g., Jupiter) yield shorter fall times and higher velocities, while weaker gravity (e.g., Pluto) produces the opposite effect. Results are visualized using graphs, confirming trends and providing insights into planetary motion dynamics.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "### Free fall describes motion under gravity alone, with acceleration dependent on the planet’s gravity. While Earth's gravity (9.81 m/s²) serves as a reference, other planets have varying gravitational forces. This variability influences fall times and velocities of objects, making it essential to study free-fall dynamics for both educational and scientific purposes.  \n",

    "### Problem Statement\n",

    "# Solving for T gives:  Fall Time $$ T = \\sqrt{\\frac{2Y}{g}} $$   \n",

    "### **1. Fall Times:**\n",
    "- **Shortest:** Jupiter (2.84s, gravity: 24.79 m/s²).\n",
    "- **Longest:** Pluto (17.96s, gravity: 0.62 m/s²).\n",
    "- **Trend:** Higher gravity → Shorter fall time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Final Velocities:**\n",
    "- **Highest:** Jupiter (70.4 m/s).\n",
    "- **Lowest:** Pluto (11.1 m/s).\n",
    "- **Trend:** Stronger gravity → Higher velocity at impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Graphs**\n",
    "- **Fall Time Graph:** Inverse relationship with gravity.\n",
    "- **Velocity Graph:** Direct relationship with gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Major Takeaways**\n",
    "- Larger planets (e.g., Jupiter) → **Shorter fall times** and **higher final velocities.**\n",
    "- Smaller planets (e.g., Pluto) → **Longer fall times** and **lower final velocities.**\n",
    "- **Gravity** plays a crucial role in determining free-fall behavior.\n",

    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "### This study successfully demonstrated the variations in free-fall behavior across different planets using a simulated common object such as 20-peso coin. Key findings include:\n",
    "### - Planets with higher gravitational acceleration (e.g., Jupiter) exhibit shorter fall times and higher final velocities.\n",
    "### - Planets with lower gravitational acceleration (e.g., Pluto) have significantly longer fall times and reduced velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Achievement of Objectives\n",
    "## The project met its objectives by:\n",
    "### - Simulating the free fall of a coin on nine different planets.\n",
    "### - Computing fall times and final velocities using the equations of motion.\n",
    "### - Visualizing and analyzing the results through graphs and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unexpected Results\n",
    "### Relatively similar fall times and final velocities for planets like Mercury and Mars, despite their differences in size and mass. This can be attributed to the similarity in their gravitational accelerations. Additionally, while Pluto's results were consistent with expectations, the significant difference in fall time highlights how gravity at the edge of our Solar System can drastically affect motion compared to planets like Jupiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work  \n",
    "- Incorporate atmospheric effects for planets with significant atmospheres.  \n",
    "- Include rotational forces in calculations.  \n",
    "- Extend simulations to moons or exoplanets.\n",
