# **Free Fall Simulation of 20-Peso Coins on Different Planets in Our Solar System**

## Introduction
<div style="text-align: justify;">
 The study of free fall is an essential part of understanding gravitational forces and their effect on objects. Objects of the same mass, such as a coin, will fall at different rates depending on the planet's gravitational pull. Gravitational acceleration is a key factor in determining the speed at which an object falls toward the surface of a celestial body. On Earth, we are accustomed to the acceleration due to gravity being approximately 9.81 m/s². However, this value varies greatly across different planets in our solar system, influencing the rate at which objects fall.

## Planets in the Simulation:
- **Mercury**: Gravity = 3.7 m/s²
- **Venus**: Gravity = 8.87 m/s²
- **Earth**: Gravity = 9.8 m/s²
- **Mars**: Gravity = 3.71 m/s²
- **Jupiter**: Gravity = 24.79 m/s²
- **Saturn**: Gravity = 10.44 m/s²
- **Uranus**: Gravity = 8.69 m/s²
- **Neptune**: Gravity = 11.15 m/s²
- **Pluto**: Gravity = 0.62 m/s²


### How the Simulation Works:
The simulation uses the following formula to calculate the fall:

### 1. Equation for height (yf)
# $$ y_f = y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$

### Where: 
+ yf is the height of the object at any given time
+ y0 is the initial height (100 meters in this case),
+ v0 is the initial velocity (0 m/s, since the coin is initially at rest)
+ g is the gravitational acceleration for the planet
+ t is the time in seconds.


### 2. Equation for velocity (vf):
# $$ v_f =  v_0 +  g  - t$$

### Where:
+ yf is the height of the object at any given time
+ y0 is the initial height (100 meters in this case),
+ v0 is the initial velocity (0 m/s, since the coin is initially at rest)
+ g is the gravitational acceleration for the planet
+ t is the time in seconds.
