# Gravitational Variations in Free Fall: A Simulation of a 20-Peso Coin Across Planets in the Solar System

## Abstract
This project explores the concept of free fall across different planets in our solar system using a 20-peso coin. The study applies Galileoâ€™s foundational principle that free fall acceleration remains constant for any object under uniform gravitational force, while acknowledging that gravity varies depending on the mass and radius of the planet. The simulation calculates the time to fall and final velocity for the coin from a height of 100 meters on Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. By integrating equations of motion, the results highlight the influence of planetary gravity, such as Jupiter's high acceleration yielding shorter fall times. Findings are compared with standard gravitational data, confirming the simulation's accuracy and demonstrating the variability of free fall in a visually engaging and educational way. This provides insights into how gravity impacts motion across different planetary environments.
